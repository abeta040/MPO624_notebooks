# MPO624_notebooks
Teaching notebooks for MPO 624

These are data processing exercises from MPO 624, with Fourier and other analyses. Two datasets are included: Time-lon sections along the equator (240 mos x 144 longitude boxes of 2.5 degrees each), and a CMAP precipitation file in .mat that has the same 240 months but global grids of rainfall.
